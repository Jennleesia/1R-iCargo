# Abstract

IATA One Record is a concept introduced by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) to streamline and modernize the air cargo industry. It aims to create a single, standardized reference for all information related to a particular air cargo shipment. This includes details such as booking, tracking, documentation, billing and payment.
 
Traditionally, air cargo processes involve multiple stakeholders, each maintaining their own records and systems, leading to inefficiencies, errors, and delays. With the IATA One Record initiative, the goal is to harmonize these processes by enabling seamless communication and data sharing among all parties involved in the air cargo supply chain.
 
By adopting a standardized data format and communication protocol, IATA One Record seeks to improve efficiency, transparency, and visibility throughout the air cargo journey, from the initial booking to the final delivery. This can result in faster processing times, reduced costs, and enhanced customer satisfaction for both shippers and logistics providers.

# Introduction

Collaboration between CCN, SATS, SQ and IBS, we initiate the POC to demonstrate how the IATA One Record concept can be implemented in real-world scenarios and to identify any challenges or issues that need to be addressed before widespread adoption. Our focus is on the creation and update of the shipment record at the MAWB and HAWB level.
